This repo contains a simple java web application (.war) for loan decisions. 
I have found it useful on some investment calculations as they look like loans in reverse.
Its can be found on openshift http://simpleloandecisions-kawalya.rhcloud.com/SimpleLoanDecisionSupport/
If its not up, you refresh the browser (up to five times) until it starts.
